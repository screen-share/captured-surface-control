        Consider a Web application |capturer| which has used {{MediaDevices/getDisplayMedia()}} to
        start capturing another [=display surface=] we call |capturee|. This specification
        introduces a set of APIs that allow |capturer| the following new capabilities:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Read and write |capturee|'s [=zoom level=].</li>
        <li>
          Deliver a wheel event over |capturee|'s viewport at coordinates of |capturer|'s choosing.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Initially, these are only specified for captured [=display surfaces=] of type [=display
        surface/browser=], but an extension to [=display surface/window=] is considered.

      <p>
        Nearly all video-conferencing Web applications offer their users the ability to share
        [=display surfaces=] - typically a browser tab ([=display surface/browser=]), a native app's
        window ([=display surface/window=]), or an entire screen ([=display surface/monitor=]).
      </p>
      <p>
        Many of these applications also show the local user a "preview tile" with a video of the
        captured [=display surface=].
      </p>
      <p>
        All these applications suffer from one key drawback - if the user wishes to interact with a
        captured [=display surface=], the user must first switch to that surface, taking them away
        from the video-conferencing application. This presents a few issues:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Users can't simultaneously interact with the captured application and see the videos of
          remote users.
        </li>
        <li>
          Users are burdened by the need to repeatedly switch between the video-conferencing
          application and the captured surface.
        </li>
        <li>
          Users are limited in their ability to see and interact with controls exposed by the
          video-conferencing application while they are interacting with the captured surface. A
          non-comprehensive list of examples of such controls includes - embedded chat applications,
          emoji reactions, "knock-ins" by users asking to join the call, and multimedia controls.
        </li>
        <!-- TODO: Reintroduce the following in a separate section focusing on potential future scope:
        <li>
          Local users who are presenting cannot delegate some limited control to remote
          participants. This leads to the all too familiar scenario, where remote users must beg the
          local user to change the slide or scroll a bit up/down.
        </li> -->
      </ol>
      <p>
        It bears mentioning that
        <a href="https://wicg.github.io/document-picture-in-picture/"
          >Document Picture-in-Picture</a
        >
        goes a long way towards addressing some of these issues. However, it not always a suitable
        solution, as not all use cases are adequately addressed by a floating window which will
        often be small, which obscures arbitrary other content on the screen, and whose size and
        positioning must be manually controlled by the user.

        This specification defines a [=policy-controlled feature=] identified by the string

          The API surfaces introduced by this specification can be categorized as either read-access
          or write-access. Note that only the write-access APIs ({{CaptureController/setZoomLevel}}
          and {{CaptureController/captureWheel}}) are gated by the <a>"captured-surface-control"</a>

        <h2>Definition of Zoom</h2>
        <p>
          We define a concept of an integer "<dfn>zoom level</dfn>" that can be applied to [=display
          surfaces=] of any type, and which is independent of the user agent and the platform. It is
          expected that in the case of [=display surface/browser=] [=display surfaces=], this
          concept will match the concept of zoom level that user agents typically exposed to the
          user.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The <dfn>default zoom level</dfn> of any [=display surface=] is defined to be 100. All
            implementations must support this value for all [=display surface=] of any type.
          </li>
          <li>
            Decreasing [=zoom level=] values represent "zooming out". The minimum theoretical value
            is 1; however, user agents may cap their support for "zooming out" at a larger values,
            with 100 being the largest permissible minimum value, representing lack of support for
            "zooming out".
          </li>
          <li>
            Increasing values represent "zooming in". This specification does not mandate a
            theoretical maximum. The smallest possible maximum is 100, which represents lack of
            support for "zooming in".
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          For a given [=display surface=] of type |surfaceType|, we define the user agent's set of
          <dfn>supported zoom levels</dfn> for |surfaceType| as a non-empty set of integers
          including at least the [=default zoom level=] (100), and not including any integers lesser
          than 1.

      <h2>Privacy and Security Considerations</h2>
      <p>
        The API surfaces introduced in this specification allow a capturing application limited
        control over a captured application. These APIs allow the capturing application to gain
        access to additional pixels in the captured application. This specification employs multiple
        means to ensure that new capabilities are used in accordance with the user's intentions.
        Among these means:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          All new capabilities introduced here are implicitly gated by the prior mitigations which
          were employed to render screen-sharing safe.
        </li>
        <li>A new {{PermissionsPolicy}} called <a>"captured-surface-control"</a> is used.</li>
        <li>
          {{CaptureController/captureWheel()}} is designed such that only the user's scrolling over
          an {{Element}} can trigger scrolling in the captured application. This API shape ensures
          that the capturing application can only [=forward wheel event algorithm|forward wheel
          events=] to the captured application at the time when the user agent dispatches the
          trusted scroll event on the capturing application itself.
        </li>
        <li>
          Setting the zoom level is gated by a requirement that is even more stringent than
          [=transient activation=]. Whereas [=transient activation=] could be used several seconds
          after the interaction, we limit zoom-setting to the exact time when the user agent
          dispatches the event associated with that interaction.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <section>
        <h3>Limiting setZoomLevel() to specific interactions</h3>
        <p>
          {{CaptureController/setZoomLevel()}} is only callable from event handlers of specific
          <a data-cite="DOM#dom-event-type">event types</a> - the
          <a>permitted event types for setZoomLevel</a>. These are events dispatched directly by the
          user agent, triggered by user interaction. We intentionally exclude from this set such
          events as <a data-cite="uievents#mousemove">"mousemove"</a>, which users are liable to
          trigger inadvertently.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Limiting element types</h3>
        <p>
          We do NOT limit the type of {{Element}} for which either
          {{CaptureController/setZoomLevel()}} or {{CaptureController/captureWheel()}} work. Such a
          limitation would accomplish nothing, because malicious applications could always overlay
          transparent permitted {{Element}} types on top of visible non-permitted {{Element}}s,
          thereby bypassing this restriction.
        </p>
        <p>
          We deem the limitation of interaction types to be sufficient. This is accomplished by
          {{CaptureController/captureWheel()}} through its shape, and by
          {{CaptureController/setZoomLevel()}} through its gating on
          <a data-cite="DOM#dom-event-type">event types</a>.
